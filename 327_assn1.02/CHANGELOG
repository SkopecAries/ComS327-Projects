Assignment 1.01
January 26th 9:00 am - Started on assignment, created main and a function for the rock border.
January 26th 6:30 pm - Defined all the variables and created a print function. Planning on making a full printMap function and using smaller methods within it.
January 26th 8:30 pm - Started printMap function, created a clearings function for the base, added in random spots for the gates, started and almost finished
with the paths (just need to figure out diagonals), and added in random locations for the buildings next to the paths.
January 29th 8:20 pm - Finally fixed my paths so they're able to go diagonal! All that's left is the random terrian and any bug testing.
January 29th 9:00 pm - Added in terrain generation for water, tall-grass, and sprinkled in some trees and rocks. Pretty much done but waiting for clarifications before submission.
January 30th - All done! (with 1.01)

Assignment 1.02
February 1st 10:00pm - Started on thinking of ideas and wrote out a few basic outlines for the program, mainly just skeleton code at most.
February 5th - Started on adjusting my functions for pointers but then ran into a lot of issues with my computer and it needs fixed.
February 6th 5:00pm - Got a rental and got back to my program. Edited all my previous functions to allow map in as a pointer.

February 7th 11:00am - Did the fly function and implemented the command coordinates into proper user input. Fixed up cleaning up the world as well.
February 7th 2:00pm - Redid the placeBuilds function regarding distance probability and adjusted other functions based on that.
February 7th 7:00pm - Had to redo a big chunk of my path function, ended up using a part of Ellie Chen's path code that she shared to help. All done now!
