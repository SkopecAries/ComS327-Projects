January 26th 9:00 am - Started on assignment, created main and a function for the rock border.
January 26th 6:30 pm - Defined all the variables and created a print function. Planning on making a full printMap function and using smaller methods within it.
January 26th 8:30 pm - Started printMap function, created a clearings function for the base, added in random spots for the gates, started and almost finished
with the paths (just need to figure out diagonals), and added in random locations for the buildings next to the paths.
January 29th 8:20 pm - Finally fixed my paths so they're able to go diagonal! All that's left is the random terrian and any bug testing.
January 29th 9:00 pm - Added in terrain generation for water, tall-grass, and sprinkled in some trees and rocks. Pretty much done but waiting for clarifications before submission.
January 30th - All done!
