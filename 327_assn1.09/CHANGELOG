Assignment 1.01
January 26th 9:00 am - Started on assignment, created main and a function for the rock border.
January 26th 6:30 pm - Defined all the variables and created a print function. Planning on making a full printMap function and using smaller methods within it.
January 26th 8:30 pm - Started printMap function, created a clearings function for the base, added in random spots for the gates, started and almost finished
with the paths (just need to figure out diagonals), and added in random locations for the buildings next to the paths.
January 29th 8:20 pm - Finally fixed my paths so they're able to go diagonal! All that's left is the random terrian and any bug testing.
January 29th 9:00 pm - Added in terrain generation for water, tall-grass, and sprinkled in some trees and rocks. Pretty much done but waiting for clarifications before submission.
January 30th - All done! (with 1.01)

Assignment 1.02
February 1st 10:00pm - Started on thinking of ideas and wrote out a few basic outlines for the program, mainly just skeleton code at most.
February 5th - Started on adjusting my functions for pointers but then ran into a lot of issues with my computer and it needs fixed.
February 6th 5:00pm - Got a rental and got back to my program. Edited all my previous functions to allow map in as a pointer.
February 6th 7:30pm - Added in a game loop for user input. Also added in north and south functions and adjusted the map creation function.
February 6th 10:00pm - Finished implementing all (but fly) movement functions. Worked on a lot of debugging and fixing errors as well. Getting close to done.
February 7th 11:00am - Did the fly function and implemented the command coordinates into proper user input. Fixed up cleaning up the world as well.
February 7th 2:00pm - Redid the placeBuilds function regarding distance probability and adjusted other functions based on that.
February 7th 7:00pm - Had to redo a big chunk of my path function, ended up using a part of Ellie Chen's path code that she shared to help. All done now!

Assignment 1.03
February 12th 7:30pm - Start on brainstorming and outlining some of the things I'll need. Still a bit confused on the output but I'm sure there'll be clarification.
February 12th 8:30pm - Added the player in random locations (on the path), and created an organized system to store terrain types and character types and made an array containing the information from the assignment guidelines.
February 13th 4:30pm - I've been stuck on how to implement Dijkstra's algorithm for a while now so I'm thinking of moving to Sheaffer's code since I've heard it's easier to work from there.
February 13th 5:30pm - Copied and made a few adjustments to the path dijkstra's algorithm to fit for the characters, also added in the printing map at the end of it.
February 19th 8:30pm - Transfered the methods I originally implemented in my own code into the professor's code.
February 20th 4:00pm - Made a lot of changes to the character dijkstra algorithm to fit better and added it to the main method. Also fixed a few issues that were popping up and issues with my console (just got my computer fixed).
February 20th 6:50pm - Doing a lot of debugging, switched to pyrite to use valgrind. I can tell I'm close but just need to do some fixes within my program.
February 20th 9:00pm - Finally figured out and fixed a bug that kept core dumping (malloced the player in the wrong function). Just need to fix my placePC function and I should be done.
February 20th 9:40pm - Finished fixing my placePC function and adjusted it so my distance maps would work with it. All done.

Assignment 1.04
February 26th 2:00pm - Decided to use Sheaffer's solution to 1.03 as a base. Starting thinking of how to implement the specs and outlining a few things.
February 26th 9:30pm - Added in NPC structure and I'm thinking of ways to print/init npcs similarly to the pc.
February 26th 10:00pm - Added in start of movement functions and started on init_npc, my brain isn't really doing much for me so I'm giving myself space for the night.
February 27th 7:00pm - Added in --numtrainers command and finished up init_npc.
February 27th 11:00pm - I've been debugging and trying to fix my print method for hours but I finally got it to work.
February 28th 12:00am - Created a next function to simplify things and I've decided I'll do just one main movement function. Finishing up tomorrow (today).
February 28th 12:30pm - Finished writing pacer, wanderer, and explorer move functions, just need to debug a bit for them to fully function and then work on rival/hiker.
February 28th 2:20pm - Got my npcs moving on the visual map and in the correct order (not just one)! Now to just finish rival/hiker movement.
February 28th 5:00pm - Finished up my rival and hiker movement functions and I'm done!

Assignment 1.05
March 18th 2:00pm - Started on looking at how to implement ncurses and brainstorming ideas.
March 18th 2:30pm - Started on initializing the terminal (with help from week 7 notes), and changing up the print_map function to fit ncurses.
March 18th 9:00pm - Finished up with the colors and getting ncurses to properly print/display.
March 18th 10:00pm - Added in the pc movement function and the keys that goes along with the movement. Currently have a rough battle function that needs updated.
March 18th 10:30pm - Decided to also fix up error message for when the user can't move somewhere so it doesn't get cleared.
March 19th 1:30pm - Finished up battle screen/function.
March 19th 2:00pm - Finished entering/exiting buildings.
March 19th 7:00pm - Finished up the trainer list/function. All done!

Assignment 1.06
March 25th 11:00am - Was going to split my main file into smaller files but ended up finding it easier to keep it the way it is and just collapse functions I'm not using. Started brainstorming ideas for c++ conversion and implementing the move functions. (I'll probably end up using Sheaffer's solution in the future to organize better but this works for now)
March 25th 8:30pm - Successfully changed my file from C to C++.
March 26th 3:30pm - I've been working for a bit now but finally figured out how to get my pc to successfully move to other maps via gates! Also changed structs to classes and implemented a character class that allows inheritence for npc and pc classes.
March 26th 4:40pm - Finished implementing the fly function. I also updated the rival/hiker npcs to just not move if they've been battled since there were a few bugs and made it so whenever the PC moves their pathfind functions are updated as well. All done!

Assignment 1.07
April 1st 11:30am - Started on thinking of ways to implement the parsing and revisiting the lecture over files.
April 1st 12:00am - Created all of my data structures that correlate to the csv files we're looking at.
April 2nd 3:00pm - Added in my verify_file and parse functions to make sure the file is valid and to parse the paths. Started on read_file.
April 2nd 6:30pm - Finished my read_file method now I just need to debug a ton of things.
April 2nd 7:00pm - Finished fixing my functions but now I can't get it to read my database locations so fixing that.
April 3rd 12:30am - Finally got everything to work as needed and added in a get_file function to reduce the amount of similar code I had for each file. 
April 3rd 1:00am - Almost forgot to add the actual data to the data structures so added that. It of course is acting up so I'm finishing tmr.
April 3rd 2:30pm - So I've gotten rid of my get_file function and just dealt with having a lot of similar code. I've gotten it to work with getting data, except now of course specific files are acting odd.
April 3rd 5:30pm - Got everything to work finally, with the data and all! Had to change pokedex to vectors to prevent stackoverflow. All done!

Assignment 1.08
April 8th 2:30pm - Using Sheaffer's solution to 1.07 as a starting point. I've been trying to get into pyrite via vsc but it hasn't been working at all so I'll have to find a different way to work on this.
April 8th 5:00pm - Finally able to get into vsc. Adjusted makefile so .csv files will be deleted upon make clobber. Also starting thinking of ways to implement the new assignment.
April 8th 8:00pm - Made pokemon.h and .cpp files and have started on my poke function which generates random pokemon. I've also added the 10% chance to encounter a pokemon in grass.
April 8th 9:30pm - Up to this point when generating a pokemon I've got the pokemon, their name, level (distance difference included), gender, shiny chance, and stats. Planning on implementing whatever else tomorrow.
April 9th 2:30pm - Been working for a while but finally finished finding moves for pokemon (first and second if possible).
April 9th 4:00pm - Added in PC starter pokemon selection screen. The pokemon isn't stored into anything for now since it's not needed but will be for future assignments.
April 9th 8:30pm - Added pokemon to all trainers and they can have up to 6 (with the 60% chance). Updated battle screen to print # of pokemon they have and their first one's stats. All done!

Assignment 1.09
April 16th 4:00pm - Starting a lot later than I planned since I was very sick yesterday (and had to catch up on a lot today), but added in my previous code and started thinking of ways to implement the new battles.
April 16th 5:30pm - Adjusted the starting portions of both pokemon and trainer battles. Planning on adding separate functions for fight, bag, and pokemon as it's going to be the same for both.
April 16th 11:30pm - Finally finished my whole fighting function. I split it up into two functions for the fight sequence and move selection. There was a lot of debugging but I eventually got there. All that I need to do left is implement the bag function (and adding items), and swapping pokemon (and running from wild pokemon).
April 17th 2:00am - Finished my bag function, just need to add in my run and swapping pokemon.
April 17th 3:00am - Added in final features like run, swapping pokemon, and a bit of debugging. (and B command for bag) All done!
