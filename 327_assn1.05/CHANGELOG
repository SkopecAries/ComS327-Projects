Assignment 1.01
January 26th 9:00 am - Started on assignment, created main and a function for the rock border.
January 26th 6:30 pm - Defined all the variables and created a print function. Planning on making a full printMap function and using smaller methods within it.
January 26th 8:30 pm - Started printMap function, created a clearings function for the base, added in random spots for the gates, started and almost finished
with the paths (just need to figure out diagonals), and added in random locations for the buildings next to the paths.
January 29th 8:20 pm - Finally fixed my paths so they're able to go diagonal! All that's left is the random terrian and any bug testing.
January 29th 9:00 pm - Added in terrain generation for water, tall-grass, and sprinkled in some trees and rocks. Pretty much done but waiting for clarifications before submission.
January 30th - All done! (with 1.01)

Assignment 1.02
February 1st 10:00pm - Started on thinking of ideas and wrote out a few basic outlines for the program, mainly just skeleton code at most.
February 5th - Started on adjusting my functions for pointers but then ran into a lot of issues with my computer and it needs fixed.
February 6th 5:00pm - Got a rental and got back to my program. Edited all my previous functions to allow map in as a pointer.
February 6th 7:30pm - Added in a game loop for user input. Also added in north and south functions and adjusted the map creation function.
February 6th 10:00pm - Finished implementing all (but fly) movement functions. Worked on a lot of debugging and fixing errors as well. Getting close to done.
February 7th 11:00am - Did the fly function and implemented the command coordinates into proper user input. Fixed up cleaning up the world as well.
February 7th 2:00pm - Redid the placeBuilds function regarding distance probability and adjusted other functions based on that.
February 7th 7:00pm - Had to redo a big chunk of my path function, ended up using a part of Ellie Chen's path code that she shared to help. All done now!

Assignment 1.03
February 12th 7:30pm - Start on brainstorming and outlining some of the things I'll need. Still a bit confused on the output but I'm sure there'll be clarification.
February 12th 8:30pm - Added the player in random locations (on the path), and created an organized system to store terrain types and character types and made an array containing the information from the assignment guidelines.
February 13th 4:30pm - I've been stuck on how to implement Dijkstra's algorithm for a while now so I'm thinking of moving to Sheaffer's code since I've heard it's easier to work from there.
February 13th 5:30pm - Copied and made a few adjustments to the path dijkstra's algorithm to fit for the characters, also added in the printing map at the end of it.
February 19th 8:30pm - Transfered the methods I originally implemented in my own code into the professor's code.
February 20th 4:00pm - Made a lot of changes to the character dijkstra algorithm to fit better and added it to the main method. Also fixed a few issues that were popping up and issues with my console (just got my computer fixed).
February 20th 6:50pm - Doing a lot of debugging, switched to pyrite to use valgrind. I can tell I'm close but just need to do some fixes within my program.
February 20th 9:00pm - Finally figured out and fixed a bug that kept core dumping (malloced the player in the wrong function). Just need to fix my placePC function and I should be done.
February 20th 9:40pm - Finished fixing my placePC function and adjusted it so my distance maps would work with it. All done.

Assignment 1.04
February 26th 2:00pm - Decided to use Sheaffer's solution to 1.03 as a base. Starting thinking of how to implement the specs and outlining a few things.
February 26th 9:30pm - Added in NPC structure and I'm thinking of ways to print/init npcs similarly to the pc.
February 26th 10:00pm - Added in start of movement functions and started on init_npc, my brain isn't really doing much for me so I'm giving myself space for the night.
February 27th 7:00pm - Added in --numtrainers command and finished up init_npc.
February 27th 11:00pm - I've been debugging and trying to fix my print method for hours but I finally got it to work.
February 28th 12:00am - Created a next function to simplify things and I've decided I'll do just one main movement function. Finishing up tomorrow (today).
February 28th 12:30pm - Finished writing pacer, wanderer, and explorer move functions, just need to debug a bit for them to fully function and then work on rival/hiker.
February 28th 2:20pm - Got my npcs moving on the visual map and in the correct order (not just one)! Now to just finish rival/hiker movement.
February 28th 5:00pm - Finished up my rival and hiker movement functions and I'm done!

Assignment 1.05
March 18th 2:00pm - Started on looking at how to implement ncurses and brainstorming ideas.
March 18th 2:30pm - Started on initializing the terminal (with help from week 7 notes), and changing up the print_map function to fit ncurses.
March 18th 9:00pm - Finished up with the colors and getting ncurses to properly print/display.
March 18th 10:00pm - Added in the pc movement function and the keys that goes along with the movement. Currently have a rough battle function that needs updated.
March 18th 10:30pm - Decided to also fix up error message for when the user can't move somewhere so it doesn't get cleared.
March 19th 1:30pm - Finished up battle screen/function.
March 19th 2:00pm - Finished entering/exiting buildings.
March 19th 7:00pm - Finished up the trainer list/function. All done!
